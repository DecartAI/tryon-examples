# Full-Featured Virtual Try-On

> Combines all features: person detection, AI-generated prompts, file upload, clothing extraction, extreme precision, and a product catalog. The most complete integration example.

Auto-detects when a person is in the camera frame, generates try-on prompts with GPT-4o-mini, lets users upload their own garment images, can extract clothing from model photos, generates high-precision try-on previews for non-trivial items, and includes a product catalog sidebar — all in one app.

## Quick start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd examples/full-featured
npm install
```

### 2. Set your API keys

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` and add both keys:

```env
DECART_API_KEY=sk_your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_your_openai_key_here
FAL_KEY=your_fal_key_here
```

> **Note:** The Decart and OpenAI keys are required. The FAL key is optional — only needed if you enable the "Extract clothing" or "Extreme precision" toggles.

### 3. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Your camera will start and MediaPipe will begin scanning. Step in front of the camera to trigger a connection, then click a product or upload your own garment.

## How it works

```
Page loads
  → Camera starts automatically (getUserMedia)
    → MediaPipe PoseLandmarker loads (WASM + WebGL, runs in browser)
      → Every 1s: detectForVideo() checks for body landmarks
        → Person detected (landmarks found)
          → Fetch client token from /api/tokens
            → Connect to Decart's lucy_2_rt model (WebRTC)
              → User clicks a product OR uploads a garment image
                → [If "Extract clothing" ON] Check for person → extract garment via FAL.AI
                → Capture a frame from the camera
                → Send garment image + person frame to /api/enhance-prompt
                → GPT-4o-mini generates a try-on prompt
                → [If "Extreme precision" ON] Capture snapshot → generate precision image via FAL.AI
                → setImage(finalImage, prompt) sends the image to the model
                  → AI video stream shows the user wearing the garment
        → Person leaves (3 consecutive misses, ~3s)
          → Disconnect from Decart (stops billing)
            → Person returns → fresh token → reconnect → re-apply last garment
```

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Person detection** | Auto-connects when someone is in frame, disconnects when they leave (saves credits) |
| **AI-generated prompts** | Generates descriptive try-on prompts from the garment image + camera frame. This example uses GPT-4o-mini, but any vision-capable LLM works (Claude, Gemini, etc.). A built-in Decart solution is coming soon. |
| **Extract clothing** | Isolates garments from model photos (e.g. from fashion websites) by removing the person and background. Uses GPT-4o-mini to auto-detect whether extraction is needed. This example uses FAL.AI Flux Klein 4B, but any image editing model works. A built-in Decart solution is coming soon. |
| **Extreme precision** | Generates a photorealistic try-on preview before sending to the real-time model. Ideal for bags, accessories, hats, and jewelry where the extra generation step produces more accurate results. This example uses FAL.AI Flux Klein 9B with a virtual try-on LoRA, but any image generation model works. A built-in Decart solution is coming soon. |
| **File upload** | Users can upload their own garment images and get AI-generated prompts automatically |
| **Product catalog** | Sidebar with product grid, click to try on |
| **Editable prompts** | View and edit the generated prompt, re-apply with one click |
| **Auto-reconnect** | When a person leaves and returns, the last garment is automatically re-applied |

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/page.tsx` | Main orchestration — detection, connect/disconnect, extraction, prompt generation, extreme precision pipeline |
| `components/CombinedView.tsx` | Video display with detection status badges, processing overlay, and prompt editor |
| `components/ProductSidebar.tsx` | Product grid, file upload, pipeline toggles, and precision preview thumbnails |
| `hooks/usePersonDetection.ts` | MediaPipe PoseLandmarker polling, exposes `personPresent` state |
| `hooks/useDecartRealtime.ts` | Decart WebRTC connection management |
| `hooks/useCamera.ts` | Camera access via getUserMedia |
| `lib/image-utils.ts` | Image processing utilities — resize, capture, extract clothing, extreme precision, person check |
| `lib/enhance-prompt.ts` | Client-side helper for calling `/api/enhance-prompt` |
| `app/api/enhance-prompt/route.ts` | Server-side GPT-4o-mini prompt generation |
| `app/api/tokens/route.ts` | Server-side Decart client token creation |
| `app/api/check-person/route.ts` | GPT-4o-mini vision — detects if an image contains a person |
| `app/api/extract-clothing/route.ts` | FAL.AI Flux Klein 4B — isolates garments from model photos |
| `app/api/extreme-precision/route.ts` | FAL.AI Flux Klein 9B + LoRA — generates photorealistic try-on previews |

## Customization

### Tuning detection sensitivity

In `hooks/usePersonDetection.ts`:

- **`DETECTION_INTERVAL_MS`** (default: 1000) — how often to check for a person
- **`MISS_THRESHOLD`** (default: 3) — consecutive missed detections before disconnecting

### Add your own products

Edit `lib/products.ts`. Each product just needs a name, image path, and price — prompts are generated automatically:

```typescript
{
  name: "Striped Polo",
  image: "/products/striped-polo.jpg",
  price: 45,
}
```

Place the garment image in `public/products/`.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `DECART_API_KEY` | Yes | Creates client tokens for realtime WebRTC connections |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes | Powers `/api/enhance-prompt` and `/api/check-person` for prompt generation and person detection. Can be swapped for any vision-capable LLM. |
| `FAL_KEY` | Optional | Powers `/api/extract-clothing` and `/api/extreme-precision` via FAL.AI. Only needed if you enable those toggles. Can be swapped for any image editing/generation model. |
